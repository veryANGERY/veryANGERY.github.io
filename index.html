                    <p>Here are my first really basic python projects : a slot machine, a rock paper scissor game, a shutdown timer for computer and a really small text based rpg. They're pretty basic and badly optimized but i'm still proud that these are mine.</p>

            <p>I'm 21, I've just started coding despite liking the feel of it since a good time now. I've started by learning some really basic Python codes and now I want to go even further by perfectioning my Python skills and learning some C#.</p>
